VMtranslator.py:
construct a Parser to parse the VM input file and a CodeWriter to
generate code into the corresponding output file.  march through the VM
commands in the input file, and generate assembly code for each one of them.
The VMtranslator can handle: stack arithmetic, memory access, branching and 
function calling commands.

Parser.py:
parsing of a single .vm file, and encapsulates access to the input code.
It reads VM commands, parses them, and provides convenient access to their
components. In addition, it removes all white space and comments

CodeWriter:
Translates VM commands into Hack assembly code

Overflow:
We handled the over flow in >,< cases. if the two number a,b have the same
sign, we could calculate a-b<0 t figure out if a<b.
